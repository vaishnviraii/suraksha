    <p>The <strong>BMC Helpline Services of Maharashtra</strong> is designed to offer <strong>24-hour support</strong> for residents needing assistance with <strong>municipal services</strong> and <strong>emergency response</strong> related to issues under the jurisdiction of the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC). It provides immediate access to services such as <strong>healthcare facilities</strong>, <strong>sanitation and waste management</strong>, <strong>road maintenance</strong>, and <strong>water supply</strong> through a single, centralized helpline.</p>

<p><strong>1916</strong> is a toll-free <strong>24-hour helpline service</strong> available for residents of Mumbai to report complaints and seek information regarding BMC services.</p>

<p><strong>1916 BMC Helpline</strong> is integrated with <strong>112</strong> - <strong>Emergency Response Support System (ERSS)</strong> to provide a coordinated response for both municipal and emergency services as needed.</p>

<p>In the future, the goal is to have <strong>112</strong> as a single emergency number, with <strong>1916</strong> focusing on non-emergency municipal support and providing critical information on <strong>civic services</strong>, <strong>health programs</strong>, and other <strong>government initiatives</strong> relevant to residents.</p>

<p>The BMC Helpline also connects residents to <strong>various civic departments</strong> and statutory officers, such as <strong>health inspectors</strong>, <strong>environment officers</strong>, and <strong>building safety officers</strong>, ensuring that citizens receive assistance with municipal regulations and local area needs.</p>
