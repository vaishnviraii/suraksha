    <p>The <strong>Maharashtra Anti-Terror Helpline</strong> is designed to provide <strong>24-hour immediate and emergency response</strong> to individuals reporting or affected by terrorism-related threats and activities. It operates through referrals, connecting callers with <strong>law enforcement agencies</strong>, <strong>emergency response teams</strong>, and <strong>other relevant authorities</strong> to ensure a swift and coordinated response to potential security risks.</p>

    <p><strong>112</strong> is a toll-free <strong>24-hour telecom service</strong> available to citizens across Maharashtra, offering support for reporting suspicious activities and receiving safety information related to terrorism.</p>
    
    <p><strong>112 Emergency Response</strong> is integrated with the <strong>Emergency Response Support System (ERSS)</strong>, a centralized service for all emergency assistance. This ensures that individuals reporting threats can access immediate intervention, whether through police response, bomb disposal units, or coordinated efforts with intelligence agencies.</p>
    
    <p>Looking forward, Maharashtra aims to streamline emergency responses by unifying critical emergency services under <strong>112</strong>, enhancing accessibility for citizens needing both immediate assistance and non-emergency guidance related to anti-terror efforts.</p>
    
    <p>The helpline will also disseminate information on <strong>government safety programs</strong> and initiatives aimed at public awareness and counter-terrorism. It will coordinate with statutory officers under various security legislations to ensure that citizens are connected with protective services and necessary support within their respective areas.</p>
