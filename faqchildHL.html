    <h2>CHILD HELPLINE (CHILDLINE)</h2>
    <h3>"Child abuse is a difficult topic, but raising awareness is key to protecting young lives."</h3>

<div class="child-helpline-container">
    <p><b>A child helpline</b> is a civil society organization, governmental body or social enterprise that provides help, support and counselling services to children <b>(18 years and under) and/or young people (25 years and under)</b> through online and offline means of communication.

        <p>Child helplines base their work on the principles of the <b>United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child (UNCRC).</b></p> 
        <p>The UNCRC spells out the basic human rights that children everywhere have: <b>the right to survival; to develop to their fullest; to protection from harmful influences, abuse and exploitation; and to participate fully in family, cultural and social life.</b> The UNCRC also specifically gives children the right to be heard and to express their views without fear of harm or reprisal. 
        <p>Child helplines help to ensure that all children have the opportunity to be heard.</p>
        <p> Often, child helplines are a child or young personâ€™s first point of contact with child protection services, and the most trusted and accessible gateway for them to find much needed further support. </p>
