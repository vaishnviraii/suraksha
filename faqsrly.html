                        In situation of early morning or late evening trains, this might be prepped considerably earlier during the previous night itself.<br>
                        Your booking standing might change any time till chart is prepared.<br>
                        Though quite uncommon, it is possible that an RAC ticket can change to wait-listed status.<br>
                        It is also possible that booking relocated from WL to CNF can return to RAC or WL.<br>
                        However none of this will certainly not happen for a ticket which was CNF while Booking itself.</p>
