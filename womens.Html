    <p>The <strong>Scheme of Women Helpline</strong> is intended to provide <strong>24 hours immediate and emergency response</strong> to women affected by <strong>violence</strong> through referral (linking with appropriate authority such as <strong>police</strong>, <strong>One Stop Centre</strong>, <strong>hospital</strong>) and information about <strong>women-related government schemes</strong> programs across the country through a single uniform number.</p>

<p><strong>181</strong> is a toll-free <strong>24-hours telecom service</strong> made available to women affected by violence seeking support and information.</p>

<p><strong>181 Women Helpline</strong> would be integrated with <strong>112</strong> - <strong>Emergency Response Support System (ERSS)</strong> for all emergency assistance.</p>

<p>In future, the endeavour would be to have a single number <strong>112</strong> for <strong>emergency response</strong> and <strong>181</strong> for taking care of all <strong>non-emergency</strong> and information dissemination services to women, girls, and children.</p>

<p>The WHL will also provide information about <strong>government schemes/programmes</strong>, <strong>facilities</strong>, and will also connect women with the statutory officers under various legislations like <strong>Dowry Prohibition Officers</strong>, <strong>Child Marriage Prevention Officers</strong>, and <strong>Protection Officers</strong> etc. as per requirement within the local area in which she resides or is employed.</p>
